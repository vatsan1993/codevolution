JSX is Syntactic Sugar. Which helps us to do the same operation as creating components using React.createElement but different simpler html like syntax.
{} are needed to write the js code inside JSX

props- message sent from one component to another component.
we can send child components in a prop aswell.
This is done so that if most of the contents stays same but there are some differences, those difference can be sent as children.
We use props.value and props.children in functional components and class component uses this.props.value and this.props.children
